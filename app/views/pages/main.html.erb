		<br />
		<p class="text white text-center" id="note">My name is Anna Davis. I am a 10th grade Algebra 2 teacher at City Arts and Tech High School in San Francisco. City Arts and Tech is a wonderful place for young men and women to grow and learn about the world. Unfortunately, our public funding leaves many of our students without the tools they need to succeed.<br /><br />
		Our school is in desperate need of graphing calculators. Many of our students come from modest backgrounds and are not able to supplement what our school fails to provide. If you have completed your own education and have a spare graphing calculator sitting around, we would be extremely grateful if you would be willing to donate it to our math program!
